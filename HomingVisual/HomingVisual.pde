/*Plans for main visuals
Concepts

A. Layering past over present

B. Showing motion

C. Using movement of partitions to switch projection
    (C.1) Allow for displaying multiple sketches?
    (C.2) More than 2 total sketches?
    (C.3) Have partitions connected to wearables? (with code, with strings)


Tech

1. Multiple cameras (A, B, C)

2. Multiple projectors (A, B, C)

3. Image difference (OpenCV)

4. Alphas? (A, B)

5. Convert motion to drawing? (B)

6. Marker Detection (OpenCV) (C)
